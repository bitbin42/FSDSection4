FSD .Net training capstone project

Phase4_Personal_project:
Code created as an exploration of React/webapi

MMStoreClient: REACT front-end code
MMStoreServer: C# web API back-end code

API.txt: defines the back-end API call formats
CreateReactApp.txt: commands for initializing the react project
CreateTables.txt: SQL commands to create tables, initial data, and sample users/passwords in the database
MMStore.postman_collection.json: sample API calls for use in postman
MMStore_initial_db.zip: backup of initialized SQL database

The MMStoreClient\src\api.js file specifies the sever and port to use for making calls to the backend server

The MMStoreServer\MSTests folder contains a basic NUinit test configuration for validating API calls to the back-end code
